# mech.v

A Coq- and Mathematical Components-based formalization project for
mechanism design, `mech.v`, with applications to many existing
mechanisms, including General VCG, VCG for Search, Combinatorial VCG,
Fixed/First/Second Price, ... and their properties.

This is Work In Progress and should do not used for "final
consumption".

This has been tested under Coq 8.15, Coq 8.16 and mathcomp 1.16.
