# mech.v

A Coq- and Mathematical Components-based formalization project for
mechanism design, `mech.v`, with applications to many existing
mechanisms, including General VCG, VCG for Search, Combinatorial VCG,
Fixed/First/Second Price, ... and their properties.

This is Work In Progress and should do not used for "final
consumption".

This has been tested under Coq 8.17 and mathcomp 1.17.
